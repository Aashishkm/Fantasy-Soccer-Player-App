# My Fantasy Sports team application
## CPSC 210 ##


What will the Application Do?

- The application will essentially allow a user to create players, and add statistics to these players
- Each player will be added to a team where their statistics can be updated
- Each team will consist of players, and each team will also have win/loss statistics 
- Essentially, the application is a tracking application that manages player and team information

Who will use it?
- Examples of people that wil use it are people that have fantasy sports teams, and want to keep track of their players
- Also, people managing soccer leagues and soccer coaches could also use this app to track player/team statistics, and update these statistics

Why is this project of interest to me?
- As a soccer player, and as someone who has a fantasy soccer team, 
I am very interested in the project because it relates to my passions, and I think it would be a great way to manage player and team data.
- Furthermore, as someone who is passionate about athletics in general, this app is very transferable and can apply to other sports as well.

Phase 4 Task 3:

Overall, I really enjoyed this process and I thought it was a great learning experience. If I had more time to work on my project, 
I would split up my classes better - split up the GUI so that it is not as long, 
and do a similar thing with my console class. Furthermore, 
I would add more methods and functionality to my programs such as being able to remove players
or being able to select predetermined players to add to a team. Overall though, looking at the design from my UML diagram,
other than splitting up some of my classes to make them clearer, 
I think that UML is pretty clear and succinct, and as a result, I probably
wouldn't change anything else. 

UML changes in point form:

- split up my GUI class
