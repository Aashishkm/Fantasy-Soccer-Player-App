# Fantasy Sports team application
## Aashish Mehra ##


What does the Application Do?

- The application allows a user to create players, and add statistics to these players
- Each player will be added to a team where their statistics can be updated
- Each team will consist of players, and each team will also have win/loss statistics 
- Essentially, the application is a tracking application that manages player and team information
- As a soccer player, and as someone who has a fantasy soccer team, I am very interested in the project because it relates to my passions,
  and I think it would be a great way to manage player and team data.
